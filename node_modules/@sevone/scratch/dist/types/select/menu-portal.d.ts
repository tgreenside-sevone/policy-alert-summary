 * This component only exists because `react-select` has a bug with measuring
 * the input component and updating the menu's position relative to it. When
 * the menu is portaled to a different component (in our case, document.body),
 * the menu is positioned absolutely. When the input's height changes due to
 * the addition/subtraction of values, the height change isn't registered until
 * after the menu has already been rerendered. So menu is still positioned
 * relative to the old height of the input. We get around this by causing a
 * second rerender of the portal every time the values change. This causes it
 * to refetch the input's new height and reposition itself properly.
